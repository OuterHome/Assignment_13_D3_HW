          <h2>Moderate Correlations Discovered Between Poverty, Healthcare, Income, and Smoking</h2>
          <p>Top statisticians at the National Institute of Health report that moderate direct correlations exist between 
              poverty and lack of healthcare coverage, concluding analysis of 2014 census and Behavioral Risk Factor 
              Surveillance System data. A moderate correlation of 0.524 was observed when considering data from all US states,
              suggesting those in poverty are at greater risk of catastrophic health bills than the general population. </p>

          <p>The study observed a correlation of 0.521 when comparing the poverty percentages of all states with their
              percentage of smokers, suggesting a moderate direct correlation between poverty and smoking. When considering the 
              increased health problems associated with smoking, those who smoke and lack health insurance are arguably exposed
              to much greater risk of future financial burden. 
          </p>

          <p>A moderate negative correlation between median household income and lack of healthcare implies that as income
              increases, the likelihood of not having healthcare decreases. This analysis did not distinguish between those
              without the ability or access to purchase healthcare, versus those who are choosing to self-insure or tolerate the
              risk of being uninsured due to their age or current health, or residents of states with government healthcare systems. 
          </p>

          <p>The strongest correlation of the study is a relatively strong negative relationship between median household income
              and the percentage of smokers in a state's population. This implies that smoking may be a relatively strong economic
              drain on the population, although we do not have specific information on the income of smokers in these states. Please
              subscribe for more information to be published on the study data in the near future.
